2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net h_plus is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin h_0[3]_i_2/O, cell h_0[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net m_plus is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin m_0[3]_i_2/O, cell m_0[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net watch_plus is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin watch_s0[3]_i_3/O, cell watch_s0[3]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net watch_plus_ is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin watch_m0[3]_i_3/O, cell watch_m0[3]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT h_0[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    h_0_reg[0] {FDRE}
    h_0_reg[1] {FDRE}
    h_0_reg[2] {FDRE}
    h_0_reg[3] {FDRE}
    h_1_reg[0] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT m_0[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 9 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    m_0_reg[0] {FDRE}
    m_0_reg[1] {FDRE}
    m_0_reg[2] {FDRE}
    m_0_reg[3] {FDRE}
    m_1_reg[0] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT watch_m0[3]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT watch_s0[3]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 9 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    one_min_reg {FDRE}
    watch_s0_reg[0] {FDRE}
    watch_s0_reg[1] {FDRE}
    watch_s0_reg[2] {FDRE}
